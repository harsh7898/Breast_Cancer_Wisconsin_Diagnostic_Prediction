**Project Title: **
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Prediction

**Description: ** 
This breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.
Here we have few features, and using them we built a classification model with 2 classes Benign and Malignant denoted as 2 and 4 in data.
